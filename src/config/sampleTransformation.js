  reflection: `I recently had a situation with one of my employees that was very painful for me. First, a
bit of history. When I started in my role as a supervisor, this person (who was my direct
report) was consistently rude, cold, and downright mean on many occasions. Over time
we worked hard to get beyond our differences, and we developed a good working
relationship that has led to many positive results. That said, she is prone to
moodiness.To make matters worse, the other team members are intimidated by her and
her bad mood can cast a black cloud over the whole day, shutting down any hope for a
positive work environment.

Recently, after a fairly lengthy period of peace and goodwill, she returned to the way
she acted when we met. She was once again treating me as though I had done
something to make her upset. There was no identifiable reason for her behavior, and it
persisted for weeks. I spent entire days feeling tense, uncomfortable, and powerless. I
also felt desperate for things to be different - to resolve and return to normal. My mind
raced with thoughts about why this was happening again. In my mind, I carried on
pretend monologues in which I told her how she was impacting the team. There was so
much energy coursing through my mind and body in those moments. It was exhausting
to hold back and hold onto that energy. My reactivity put me at risk of saying something
that I would regret. I dreaded going to work.

As I reflect on the whole experience, even back to the beginning of my time in this job, I
realize that my pain identity as the unjustifiably wronged person — the victim — was
fully present and engaged in the conflict. I spent a great deal of energy on aversion to
what was happening, and an equal amount of effort trying to soothe and bolster my own
ego — my belief in my solid "self" and my identity as a supervisor. Looking back now, I
was so preoccupied with how to escape the discomfort that I had difficulty focusing on
my routine tasks and struggled in moments where my expertise and leadership had to
be put into action. I was disempowered and deflated.`,

  practice: `Taking refuge has been my primary practice since the retreat, and I have repeatedly
done guided meditation sessions in which that is the focus. Practicing this way on a
daily basis made this the natural choice for me to utilize both on and off the mat.

One morning, after struggling so much with this situation, I had a momentary realization
that my employee must be suffering, too. Somehow I was able to shift my thinking away
from seeing myself as a victim, and set an intention to send her lovingkindness during
my meditation. I did my meditation as usual, but incorporated my own version of
Tonglen and Lovingkindness with her as the object. That helped me to soften and calm
my mind down during my meditation practice.`,

  progression: `The first approach I took was to take refuge in spaciousness — to try to open up to
spaciousness of mind so that I didn't feel so constricted, tense and tight in my raging
thoughts. I also worked with spaciousness to create a sense of space around this
employee — to recognize that there is a great deal of freedom from suffering in that
space. That helped tremendously because it allowed me somewhat of an escape in that
moment - not an escape from my feelings, but an escape to a less constricted mindset
where I could recognize my feelings and feel safe doing so. There is a saying I heard
recently at work, "the solution to pollution is dilution". That statement refers to dealing
with infection in a patient, but I thought it was quite fitting for my use of spaciousness in
those moments of toxic constriction. Recognizing spaciousness definitely dilutes the
strength of any one strong emotion for me.

Spaciousness and breathing was definitely effective. But, I found myself still having that
energy moving in my body—coming up into my throat with the urge to engage in a
verbal confrontation with her, not to mention the chaos of my inner dialogue. That's
when I did my most effective practice, which was taking refuge in silence.

One particular morning I arrived at work and this employee was visibly agitated. She
started making comments here and there that felt passive aggressive towards me. So, I
took refuge in silence. I didn't respond at all to her passive aggressive comments, and
when she spoke directly to me, my only response was "okay", which I said in a neutral
tone of acknowlegement. I said nothing else to her. I used the breath to take the place
of words in the back of my throat, and was able to slow my heart rate and provide
myself with relief in those uncomfortable moments. It was very effective!

This went on for several days. I didn't engage her in conversation, and my responses to
her were minimal yet kind. I finally felt myself releasing the tension that had built up in
my mind and body.

The following weekend, I got a text from this employee that had a picture of fresh corn
on the cob that she had grown in her garden. She followed it up with a text saying,
"these are for you. I know how much you love corn on the cob."

I have remained in a very stable place energetically since that experience. It was a
breakthrough moment for me.`,
